# Algorithmic
The goal is to understand concepts found in the [Top 10 Algorithms in Interview Questions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-10-algorithms-in-interview-questions/)

Most attempts at these topics will be live streamed via [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/kaycem) and also viewable afterwards.
The hope here with live streaming is the following:
```
- more verbal communication will occur, simulating an interview-like environment
- there will be more pressure to actually learn the material in a given time frame.
- viewers will get to learn and interact with topics.
- self performance documentation so that I may review my approach and learn where I can improve.
```

The purpose of this directory is to provide jupyter notebooks on algorithmmic topics commonly used in technical interviews.
This will also give me the opportunity to practice my python coding skills while reviewing general concepts.
