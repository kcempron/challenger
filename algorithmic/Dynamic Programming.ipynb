    "# Longest Common Subsequence\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "Given two string sequences, find the length of longest subsequence present in both of them. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous. For example, “abc”, “abg”, “bdf”, “aeg”, ‘”acefg”, etc. are subsequences of “abcdefg”. So a string of length `n` has `2^n` different possible subsequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "The initial approach compares the first value of each string and then the following substrings. This will look like a tree structure that will either count the subsequence if `a[0] == b[0]` for string inputs `a` and `b` or consider the `LCS(a[1:], b) or LCS (a, b[1:])`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach will give a runtime of `O(2^n)` and actually unnecessarily recomputes for some substrings of `a` and `b`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would like to remove the recompute time and actually cache it so when a call to `LCS(a, b)` is made again, we can return the value immediately. This memoized approach creates a `2d` matrix `M` of size `m*n` where `m = len(a) and n = len(b)`. We then populate the `M` top down and count the longest common subsequence at some index pair `(i, j)`.\n",
    "Once we've computed all of the matrix values, we return `M[m][n]` which will contain the longest common subsequence after considering all the characters in `a` and `b`."

    "# Longest Increasing Subsequence\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem is to find the length of the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. For example, the length of LIS for {10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80} is 6 and LIS is {10, 22, 33, 50, 60, 80}.\n",
