# EliteCode
The goal is to complete all the useful [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) questions at a rate of roughly 10 questions/week.

Most attempts at these questions will be live streamed via [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/kaycem) and also viewable afterwards.
The hope here with live streaming is the following:
```
- more verbal communication will occur, simulating an interview-like environment
- there will be more pressure to actually attempt the problems in a given time frame.
- viewers will see a realistic approach at a problem opposed to just reading a solution write-up.
- self performance documentation so that I may review my attempts and learn where I can improve.
```

With there being roughly 1000 questions, this task should take at most 100 weeks or roughly 2 years. The goal, of course, is to complete this challenge in half that time.

The purpose of this directory is to provide developer/hacker notes after completing a week's worth of questions to reflect on any interesting problems and overall weekly performance.
